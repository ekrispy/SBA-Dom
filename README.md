# SBA-Dom
Alright.... This was a bit top much, worked on it for multiple hours, but was able to get it to work, thanks to google!
the page has a button to generate dinner ideas through a list of items in arrays for protiens, carbs, vegtables, and recipes
you can continue to push the button to generate new dinner ideas that was set with math.random property

once you push the button a shopping list is generated and it comes from the dinners created for the days monday through friday
if you dont like the ideas for a certian day you can click the day and cross it out, but it does not update the shopping list unfortunatly...

for the shopping list, you are able to remove items by clicking the remove button and it takes it away from the list

if you like the dinner ideas and shopping list with items you need you can send it to yourself... does not actually , but would be cool if it did.
